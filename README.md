###                a)	Live Data API (Responsible for Device configuration change)
###                b)	Data Binding (Reduce boilerplates of code so increase app performance.)
       
       
      
In this project i have used Live dataApi and MVVM Architecture for code pattern with Databinding.
I used Retrofit for network call for data fatching.
For circular image view i used external library and for image loading i Used Glide library.
Live data APi is used to handle all screen configuration changes.
MVVM structure is very neat and clean Architecture for android project.
Data binding is used for set data in views with help of this library we can reduce lots of code.
